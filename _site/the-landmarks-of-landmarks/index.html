  <h1>The Landmarks of *Landmarks*</h1>
  <p>In 2016's <em>Landmarks</em>, MacFarlane still feels like a writer with his backpack on, but somehow there's also a 19th-century thesaurus in there with the parka and compass. Anyone sharing his simultaneous fascination with language and landscape will devour it like catnip.  In exploration of how we talk about where we live, he charts a course through some magical nature writing with care and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The fact that many of the works he chose are now available in editions featuring introductions by MacFarlane himself is a testament to what I'm going to dub &quot;The MacFarlane Effect.&quot; If you enjoyed <em>Landmarks</em>, the works around which MacFarlane blazed its trail are obvious directions to head next. If you just love nature writing, you'll find wonderful places to get lost here.</p>
