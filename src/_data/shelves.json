[{"shelfID":"a-memory-palace-the-size-of-a-nation-state","title":"Audiobooks for the trail: a memory palace the size of a nation-state","description":"When I think of any of these books, I cannot help but be transported to the places where I was walking while listening to them. I won't forget **Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand** on Hat Creek Rim. Or **How to Change Your Mind** deep in the mushroom-dense forests of Oregon. Starting ***Heavy*** in a hailstorm around Crater Lake. And I can tell you the mile marker (1285) and the date (July 14, 2019) I finally finished ***Kristin Lavransdatter***. Heck I remember the who the hiker leapfrogging me the moment I *realized* I was going to finish ***Kristin Lavransdatter***. His trail name was Tarzan.\nIn 2019, I walked every step of the 2,650 miles [Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/) from the U.S.-Mexico border north to the Canada-U.S. border, a string of unbroken footsteps that stretched 2,650 miles. It was exhilerating and grueling and life-affirming and mortality-confronting. And I'm not sure how I wouldn't have done it without a [libro.fm](http://libro.fm) subscription.\nI listened to plenty of music and consumed tons of podcasts. I also read a handful of paperbacks as well. The point is that these are the audiobooks (I'm leaving the duds out) that got me through some long days and made interminable climbs a bit easier. The sound of one's own feet aren't always enough.\nI genuinely treasure the entertwined memories of these books and my time hiking across the country. If there's one takeaway I would offer you, it is that  ***somebody tells you they are going to hike a long trail, give them a [libro.fm](http://libro.fm) gift card.**","attribution":"Steven","categories":[],"books":["9780743203968","9781501125669","9780525576716","9780735224155","9780143039167","9781439195468","9781250806710","9780393356250","9780819567147","9781250234957"],"originFileType":"shelf","dateCreated":"2022-06-02T06:18:56.147Z","dateModified":"2022-08-11T05:19:38.000Z"},{"shelfID":"books-i-have-enjoyed-in-2022","title":"Books I have enjoyed in 2022","description":"Last year's reading slump continued into this year.

Also, I discovered that I needed reading glasses and... while I'm not over the blow to my ego, it has made a huge difference.
