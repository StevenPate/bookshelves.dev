For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? What was really happening during the periods that we usually describe as the emergence of \"the state\"? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

In these troubling times we all yearn for a better world. But many of us feel powerless and uncertain what we can do. Thich Nhat Hanh (Thay) is blazingly clear: there's one thing that we have the power to change--and which can make all the difference: our mind. How we see and think about things determines all the choices we make, the everyday actions we take (or avoid), how we relate to those we love (or oppose), and how we react in a crisis or when things don't go our way. Meditation trains us to see reality as it is. But many of us have a distorted view, caused by negative stories about the world and ourselves that have become ingrained. To use our mind for change, we must see clearly. Thay shows us how us to alter our way of thinking, to break free from the notions that block our way, to find truth and touch reality as it is. By breaking down these old stories, we gain the insight and energy we need to take the right kind of action to save the planet and ourselves. Filled with powerful examples of engaged action he himself has undertaken, inspiring Buddhist parables, and accessible daily meditations, this powerful spiritual guide offers us a path forward, opening us to the possibilities of change and how we can contribute to the collective awakening and environmental revolution our fractured world so desperately needs.","categories":["Religion"],"publishedDate":"2021-10-05"},"openlibrary":{"subjects":["Buddhism"],"lc_classifications":["BQ4570.E58N43 2021"],"pagination":"320"},"bookshopOrg":{"cover":"https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9780062954794.jpg?height=1000&","cachedCover":"<picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/web/MXKuJw_HQg-267.webp 267w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"/images/web/MXKuJw_HQg-267.avif 267w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><img class=\"book-cover\" alt=\"9780062954794\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" duration=\"1y\" src=\"/images/web/MXKuJw_HQg-267.jpeg\" width=\"267\" height=\"400\"></picture>"}},{"ISBN":"9780811228787","shelves":[{"shelf":"books-i-have-finished-in-2022","details":{"description":"Description of The Dry Heart."}}],"identifiers":{"isbn":["0811228789"],"isbn13":["9780811228787"],"lccn":[],"oclc":[],"openlibrary":["OL28906673M"],"goodreads":["42268742"]},"google":{"title":"The Dry Heart","authors":["Natalia Ginzburg"],"description":"Finally back in print, a frighteningly lucid feminist horror story about marriage","categories":["Fiction"],"publishedDate":"2019"},"openlibrary":{"subjects":["Marriage, fiction","Fiction, general"],"identifiers":{},"classifications":{},"translated_from":[{"key":"/languages/ita"}],"contributors":[{"role":"Translator","name":"Frances Frenaye"}],"translation_of":"È stato così","lc_classifications":["PQ4817.I5E213 2019"],"first_sentence":{"type":"/type/text","value":"\"Tell me the truth,\" I said."},"pagination":"88","copyright_date":"1952","publish_places":["New York, USA"]},"bookshopOrg":{"cover":"https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9780811228787.jpg?height=1000&","cachedCover":"<picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/web/Kj5BCv44e2-259.webp 259w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"/images/web/Kj5BCv44e2-259.avif 259w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><img class=\"book-cover\" alt=\"9780811228787\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" duration=\"1y\" src=\"/images/web/Kj5BCv44e2-259.jpeg\" width=\"259\" height=\"400\"></picture>"}},{"ISBN":"9781771644198","shelves":[{"shelf":"books-i-have-finished-in-2022","details":{"description":"Tree description, which has a subtitle set off by a colon.

The move may very well be advisable for navigating the world we have made for ourselves and reflect (in the editors' words) “the consensus experience of modern-day childhood.\" Nevertheless Macfarlane convincingly argues the cull reflects the loss of something deeper, something shared between the people of a place in their language. \n\n*Landmarks* is partly a lament for our lack of understanding of the natural world&mdash;and more precisely the very specific ways of talking about and living in very specific places. To name something is often to be able to see it: to learn that \"smeuse\" is a term in Sussex for the \"gap in the base of a hedge made by the regular passage of a small animal\" means being able to notice something new on your walk through the countryside. Nine glossaries mark the chapters of the book, each filled with dialectical variants of terms for the natural and geologigical features of precisely experienced places from a writer equally captivated by language and landscape.

In this, his fifth book, Macfarlane brilliantly explores the linguistic and literary terrain of the British archipelago, from the Shetlands to Cornwall and from Cumbria to Suffolk, offering themed glossaries of hundreds of these rare, deeply local, poetical terms, organized by such geographical terrains as flatlands, uplands, waterlands, coastlands, woodlands, and underlands. Interspersed with this archive of place words are biographical essays in which Macfarlane writes of his favorite authors who have paid close attention to the natural world and who embody in their own work the huge richness of place language—from Barry Lopez and John Muir to Nan Shepard, J. A. Baker, and Roger Deakin. Landmarks is a book about the power of language and how it can become a way to know and love landscape, from a writer acclaimed for his own precision of utterance and distinctive, lyrical voice.","categories":["Nature"],"publishedDate":"2016-08-02"},"openlibrary":{"subjects":["Description and travel","Geography in literature","Travel","Human geography","Language and culture","Historical linguistics","Landscapes","Terminology","Geography"],"lc_classifications":["DA632"],"pagination":"x, 434 pages"},"bookshopOrg":{"cover":"https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9780241967874.jpg?height=1000&","cachedCover":"<picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/images/web/nBLxkKee8L-264.webp 264w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"/images/web/nBLxkKee8L-264.avif 264w\" sizes=\"50vw\"><img class=\"book-cover\" alt=\"9780241967874\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" duration=\"1y\" src=\"/images/web/nBLxkKee8L-264.jpeg\" width=\"264\" height=\"400\"></picture>"}},{"ISBN":"9780857861832","shelves":[{"shelf":"the-landmarks-of-landmarks","details":{"description":"\"My eyes were in my feet.\" --Nan Shepherd\n\nThe beautiful, patient specifiity of Nan Shepherd's revered meditation on years of wandering the austere Cairngorm mountains in Scotland, works on you like a spell.

A crucial figure in the creation of our national parks system and a far-seeing prophet of environmental awareness who founded the Sierra Club in 1892, he was also a master of natural description who evoked with unique power and intimacy the untrammeled landscapes of the American West. Nature Writings collects Muir's most significant and best-loved works in a single volume, including: The Story of My Boyhood and Youth (1913), My First Summer in the Sierra (1911), The Mountains of California (1894) and Stickeen (1909). Rounding out the volume is a rich selection of essays—including \"Yosemite Glaciers,\" \"God's First Temples,\" \"Snow-Storm on Mount Shasta,\" \"The American Forests,\" and \"Save the Redwoods\"—that highlight various aspects of his career: his exploration of the Grand Canyon and of what became Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks, his successful crusades to preserve the wilderness, his early walking tour to Florida, and the Alaska journey of 1879.
