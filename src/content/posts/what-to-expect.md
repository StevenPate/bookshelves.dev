The goal of this project to explore ideas about books, bookstores and web technologies to bring them together. I have some long-simmering ideas I would like to finish cooking and share with people. Here is what I expect to post about on this site.

I plan to write about **the ways we encounter books** we love and the* bookstores that facilitate those encounters*. It is worth exploring how our *digital learning, searching and reading experiences* fit into that conversation.

I'll also write extensively about *how I am building this site* from the ground up to test out new web technologies and appraise their usefulness, hopefully figruing out a whole lot of new things along the way.

I'm also keen to share more about the concepts of *learning in public* and *digital gardens*, which are important underpinnings for this project. There are related topics to explore, such as the *indieweb* and *web3*, which touch on the idea of moving back to a de-centralized web which fosters more individual ownership and creativity.
