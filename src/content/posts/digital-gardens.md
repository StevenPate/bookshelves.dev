When I read Joel Hooks description on [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I was hooked. He calls the digital garden "a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting 'showpiece'" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there." But he says so much more than that. It's a quick read, and I recommend it.

A garden is a place where things grow, and where we can work together. But they need tending.

I am in something approximating awe of [Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden). Everything about it is pleasing and engaging. I would especially recommend her deep dive into [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

Maggie's [list](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880) is super useful, and her [digital gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) is really beyond thorough.

[Chris Bisardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/what-is-a-digital-garden):
> A Digital Garden is lowercase b blogging. It's writing without worrying about what people will think. It's writing in small, unfinished pieces and building them up to larger more edited pieces, in public. This is in contrast to big B blogging, which can be thought of as writing a 6k+ word thinkpiece or the authoritative work on topic X without shipping any smaller pieces.

>The Garden is what I was doing in the wiki as I added the Gun Control articles, building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning.
>The Stream is a newer metaphor with old roots. We can think of the”event stream” of programming, the “lifestream” proposed by researchers in the 1990s. More recently, the term stream has been applied to the never ending parade of twitter, news alerts, and Facebook feeds.
>In the stream metaphor you don’t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.
