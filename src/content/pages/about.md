One day I realized: In bookstores, I almost always encounter the books I didn't even know I wanted to read. But that almost never happens on bookstore *websites*. Why?

In the physical store, booksellers create spaces to encounter books. Theu showcase their curation, take pride in their recommendations, through shelf-talkers or conversation.

Online, this so often just gets lost in search boxes and scrolling through pages of product links.

I get excited about books I read about in newsletters in articles or on social media. Then if I'm being a good and well-behaved bibliophile, I head to the website of an independent bookstore and try and try to buy it from them. I may *find* the book there, but I didn't *encounter* it there.

So I've been thinking that fostering encounters with books is really the magic of bookstores. They are great at doing this in physical spaces, because they are there shaping those encounters all the time through the arrangement of the space, the makeup of the shelves and displays, and of course because they can talk to you and guide you in helpful directions.

I'd love to see indie bookstores translate that capacity for introducing me to new books through 

They could focus on their unique recommendations and use original content to merchandise books. They could lead with the curation and expertise of their booksellers, not with a search box or an exhaustive menu of categories. This site will document of my plodding attempt to **build the online bookshop I wish existed**.

A bookstore is not a collection of books for sale. <mark class="bg-amber-100">A bookstore is: booksellers plus space.</mark> What I'm really asking is what could this mean when **extended to the _online_ space?** And boy do I have opinions.

This project is primarily a learning exercise, though I really hope some other folks will find it useful.

### If you want to know a little bit more:

A new landscape of apps, frameworks, and APIs offers an opportunity to imagine something new. **The pandemic-catalyzed reliance on online shopping is not going away**. A better world is possible if we build it together.

I wish I were in a bookstore right now, and maybe you do too. There's no substitute for that space. But maybe there's a <em>better</em> substitute, <mark class="bg-amber-100">an experience truly complements and strengthen the physical presence of bookstores that I love</mark>. If not, I know that there are some interesting things to learn and interesting people to and learn from along the way.

I'm [Steven](https://stevenpate.com/). Absolutely nobody asked me to do this. But also: nobody who knows me will be surprised I'm trying ayway.

Thanks for reading this!
