  description: A day in the life of a pleading parent and a child just being a child. This one has an undeniably fun cadence to read and a sweet ending. I'm not sure why the mundane antics of a very typical kid feel like a drop of therapy for any parent reading it, and the misbehavior showcased for the kid is so low-stakes that the overall effect is just to reinforce good behaviors.

  description: We are big fans of illustrator Brendan Wenzel, and this tour through the backyard insect menagerie written by Angela DiTerlizzi always has something new to show us. There's a big gray cat exploring the landscape, and always a ladybug in the picture somewhere, as we are guided by the book's economical but fun rhyming text. With all the books identified on the "What's that bug page" and a wonderful revelation that the previous pages have in fact been a tour through the child's back yard, this one is a delight. It's colorful and great for introducing the insect world to the very little or inviting the interest of the somewhat squeamish.

  description: Four of Burton's most popular stories in one handsome volume. _Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel_ might be the most popular, and _The Little House_ was deservedly won the Caldecott Medal, but it's _Katy and the Big Snow_ that has been the favorite in our house. These are tales of hard work, determination and meeting the challenges of new landscapes and changing worlds, with a healthy dose of almost quaint 20th-century optimism. They are imaginatively told and really fun to look at.

  description: \"The cat walked through the world, with its whiskers, ears and paws...\" On my short-list for favorite reads of all, _They All Saw A Cat_ is a truly brilliantly imagined and illustrated examination of how a cat looks to all the other animals it encounters. Showing us not only the interaction of these creatures but introducing young readers to the profound role of perspective and it justifiably snagged a Caldecott Medal.

  description: Thanks to this book, I can make my kid laugh hysterically just by saying the words "Red. Ripe. Strawberry." An impossibly cute book.

  description: J loves blueberries. And strawberries. And raspberries. OK, of all berries. So this short, rollicking fantasia of a paradise of berries, with a fuzzy bear playing Virgil is always a big hit.

  description: We love the cadence of this book, the exagerrated depiction of an imaginary monster, the unexpected turn when the monster turns out to be real and the clever story of how the mouse outsmarts the monster he summoned. Every time.

  description: |
    What a debut for a giant of children's illustration. Its the distinctive 
    style, the clever conceit connecting page to page, the breaking of the fourth wall...
    *Brown Bear* is just incredible to me.
