  description: I'm not sure it is possible to start _The Dry Heart_ and not finish
    the book before closing it. It is as if this intimate, unsparing account of a
    marriage's unraveling gets right under your skin and there's nothing to do about
    it but to keep reading its haunting style. The clarity and directness of its prose
    feels at first like an unbearably and intensely focused light. It reveals, like
    a doctor's lamp. Another metaphor, from the title, is even better. It is dry and
    desiccated in a breathtakingly clarifying way. The dry heart. What a title. What
    a first line.
