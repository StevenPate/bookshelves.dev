    description: This is one of the books I've gotten at Port Book and News in Port Angeles to help acquaint myself with the Olympic Peninsula. I loved its first sentence so much, I suggested ot to Madison Books for [the "First Lines that Last" feature in their newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/84198621b62e/madison-books-newsletter-119) last year, but I re-read it this year once I moved here.

      A provocative account of how we came to organize our societies provides
      hope for making them better. https://pca.st/podcast/75172180-4b4a-0133-c348-0d11918ab357... Understanding that we have the power to make this world better is especially important during times when everything seems aligned to thwart us. Among the most profound obstacles to imagining a world without exploitation and oppression is the received wisdom telling us that it has to be this way. In ***The Dawn of Everything***, archaeologist David Wengrow and the late anthropoligist David Graeber have given us a sprawling, challenging and inspiring corrective to some of the most entrenched furrows of that received wisdom. One of their principal targets is the idea that the adoption of agriculture necessarily meant a wealth accumulation, inequality and technological acceleration. This account has been popular in some bestselling accounts of recent years (such as *Guns, Germs and Steel*, *Sapiens*, and *Against the Grain*) but ignores the growing body of evidence against it. The idea that we have passed through a "progression" of development from hunter-gatherers to sedentary agriculturalists to urban city states to a globalized web of capitalist nation states is itself one of the enlightenment era just-so stories that don't stand up to scrutiny, at least according to Graeber and Wengrow's survey of recent research. People have lived in all sorts of ways, sometimes in very large numbers and in arrangements that lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. Things, it turns out, are far messier and maybe more hopeful than we've been led to believe. Anyone who enjoyed ***Debt~&#58;~ the first 5,000 Years**\* or any of the much-beloved Graeber's work won't need any arm-twisting. This is provocative, captivating and mostly convincing extrapolation of one of Graeber's oft-quoted lines~&#58;~ "The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently."

      You don’t see a lot of self help books on your average “Global Climate Change” reading list, unless you count those helping people attend to their energy use or consumer habits. This one is different. 
      In *Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet*, Nhat Hanh (or Thay, as he was known), patiently guides us to take care of ourselves in order to foster our resiliance and streng for the work of taking care of eachother and the world. When it sometimes feels like we face challenges so overwhelming that there is nothing we can do to help, Thay offers wisdom to put that in perspective. I will not soon forget his account of using meditation to overcome despair when working to stop the war in his native Vietnam, another overwhelming, life-threatening and seemingly intractable challenge. There is great teaching here on listening compassionately to others whom you may be inclined to fear or hate. This book offered me new tools to keep my cool and seek genuine dialog when talking to people I might see as complicit in the climate crisis or whose reluctance to face it I may resent.
      The idea that surviving global climate change means first dealing with our own anxiety and despair seems both obvious and under-appreciated. My intuition is this book will be most impactful for those already predisposed to buddhist teachings, but Thay’s accounts of political engagement and the interconnectedness of everything . The author of 75 books available in English (his 1992 work *Peace Is Every Step* is particularly resonant to me), Thay died just days ago. [His legacy is enormous], and this book is one epic and generous gift before departing.

    description: Tree description, which has a subtitle set off by a colon. Watch out!. https://roamresearch.com/#/app/PeripateticNotes/page/P_gZPo-IM... How about a book that feels like sitting down with David Suzuki, one of the best-known environmentalists in Canada, to hear a masterful, stem-winding biography (botanograpy?) of a tree? // most well-known environmentalist in Canada // It feels like sitting beneath a tree and listening to a master lecturer skillfully slideing from topic to topic in a supernaturally informed lecture that doesn't feel exhaustive like a textbook. Startling facts, reveries, anecdotes. The similarity of hemoglobin to chlorophyll, the galapogos tomato whose seeds can only germinate if they pass through the digestive system of a tortoise. // Lichens and salmon, sunlight and spotted owls. // The story of a single tree, from the moment the seed is released from its cone until, more than five hundred years later, it lies on the forest floor as a nurse log, giving life to ferns, mosses, and hemlocks, even as its own life is ending. Revised edition with a foreword by Peter Wohlleben, author of The Hidden Life of Trees.

    description: If you would like to read something unlike anything you have ever read, __Pure Color__ is an excellent choice. All your expectations are likely to be confounded, even if they derive from Heti's earlier works, as this isn't the high-wire act of self-scrutiny that made __How Should a Person Be__ and __Motherhood__ so celebrated. From one of its brief chapters to the next, his book can feel like a modern-day fable, like an autofictional foray into magical realism, or like a transparent vehicle for smuggling philosophy and aesthetics into the Fiction section. Mostly, though, it feels like having a conversation with someone you slowly realize is an absolute kook. This is a good thing! It's the kooks who end up with all the out-there ideas that start our movements, change our paradigms and shake up our world views. And boy does the cosmology of protagonist Mira fit the bill. Mira is on her way to being art critic who gets hung up on an unrequited love and waylaid by the death of her father. Some of the book's dominant conceits, like that we are living in the first draft of the world during the moments where God is on the verge of ripping it up for the second, and that everyone is either a bird, a fish or a bear (a sort of faux-naive myers-briggs diagnostic for a world  in which the supreme being is a sort of critic) scaffold a unique conception of the world which undergirds the story. The account of Mira's life often reads someone channeling the cosmic assurance of a lost pre-socratic philosopher into a spiritual text for children. Heti takes weird, simultaneous stabs at the ineffable and mundane and again reaffirms herself as a writer unafraid to go into new places that surprise me and make me think. I didn't know about this book until I heard Heti talking about it on the [Between the Covers Podcast](https://tinhouse.com/podcasts/) (which, if you don't know about it, is just something you're going to need to really check out).

    description: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131191.Life_Among_the_Savages?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3HrKXYaZR4&rank=1 Might be revelatory if you, like me, had only read her horror stuff. So funny. Well observed and constructed.

Last year's reading slump has continued into this year. Pandemic and parenthood notwithstanding, there is hope. I'm in a new place with a nice library and a [couple](https://www.odysseybooksgifts.com/) of [great](https://www.portbooknews.com/) bookstores, and have added many of the books that were waiting for me in storage to my TBR shelf. I've finished a really big book (**The Dawn of Everything**) and am making progress on some other things. For now I'm limiting this list to books that I have both finished and which I would recommend.
