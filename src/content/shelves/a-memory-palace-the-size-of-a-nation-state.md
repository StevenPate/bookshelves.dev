      This was one of the specific titles recommended for consumption in audiobook format (thank you Andy). He was right about the match of narrator Laurie Anderson and the tone of Delillo's text, which is somehow clear about the obscurity of its subject matter.

      An artist occupies a lonely rented house and discovers a mysterious, ageless man with inexplicable knowledge of her own life in this short, haunting tale. It's a ghost story, a study of grief and loneliness, and a deep dive into the artistic process. Through the arid deserts of southern California, it was Don DeLillo's storytelling prowess and impeccable sentences that got me really hooked on
      
      
      As
      "She practices what she calls “bodywork,” a series of exercises, stretches, and expressive postures she has devised to maintain fitness for her performances. She chops firewood. She stares for hours at footage from a webcam overlooking a road in Finland." Storytelling. Obscurity. Mystery. Mastery. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hraFAwRWIgY "Is she hallucinating? DeLillo is not concerned with the psychology behind this; a mysterious man Lauren loved is gone, and the world must fill his absence."

      I remember getting hooked into this around Crater Lake.

      In this powerful, provocative, and universally lauded memoir—winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal and finalist for the Kirkus Prize—genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon “provocatively meditates on his trauma growing up as a black man, and in turn crafts an essential polemic against American moral rot” (Entertainment Weekly). In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to time in New York as a college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. Heavy is a “gorgeous, gutting…generous” (The New York Times) memoir that combines personal stories with piercing intellect to reflect both on the strife of American society and on Laymon’s experiences with abuse. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, he asks us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free. “A book for people who appreciated Roxane Gay’s memoir Hunger” (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel), Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family through years of haunting implosions and long reverberations. “You won’t be able to put [this memoir] down…It is packed with reminders of how black dreams get skewed and deferred, yet are also pregnant with the possibility that a kind of redemption may lie in intimate grappling with black realities” (The Atlantic).

    desription: Listened to this one a couple of times on the trail in NorCal. Some things stuck deeply. "The part of Buddhism that I’m defending is the claim that the reason we suffer is because we don’t see the world clearly, and that that’s also the reason we make other people suffer." "Basically, our brains are not wired for peace and happiness--only to propel our genes forward. There's a yearning for more programmed into us and the only antidote is mindfulness meditation. "
