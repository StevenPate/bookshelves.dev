description: I'm not sure it is possible to start _The Dry Heart_ and not finish
  the book before closing it. It is as if this intimate, unsparing account of a
  marriage's unraveling gets right under your skin and there's nothing to do about
  it but to keep reading its haunting style. The clarity and directness of its prose
  feels at first like an unbearably and intensely focused light. It reveals, like
  a doctor's lamp. Another metaphor, from the title, is even better. It is dry and
  desiccated in a breathtakingly clarifying way. What a title. What a first line.

  Italo Calvino praised 'the flavor, the stern clarity that drives the story right through, unfaltering, to the end—that’s the reason that you have to read it all in one sitting.'

  Deborah Eisenberg called 'the equilibrium of clarity' and praised 'the quality of her attention is singular.'
